🎬 In This Video: Struggling to make sense of unfamiliar GitHub repos? DeepWiki might just save you hours of manual code reading.  
  
In this review, we explore DeepWiki, the latest AI-powered documentation tool from Cognition Labs, the same team behind Devin AI. Designed for developers who constantly wrestle with complex or undocumented codebases, DeepWiki offers a Wikipedia-style breakdown of any public GitHub repository—just by changing the URL.  
  
You’ll see how DeepWiki breaks down architecture, explains core logic, and visualizes code relationships with interactive diagrams. It also includes a built-in AI assistant that answers context-aware questions based on the actual code. Whether you’re onboarding to a new project, reviewing code, or just learning, this tool accelerates understanding like nothing else on the market.  
  
We'll also cover pricing (it's free for public repos), real limitations, and why this tool stands out among AI dev tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor.  
  
Try it out by swapping github.com with deepwiki.com in any repo URL. If this video helped, hit like and subscribe for more deep dives into AI tools transforming development, design, and productivity.
